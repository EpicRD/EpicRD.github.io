        <label class="epic-justify">Previous UI of ComDash</label>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>What Is The Proposed UI Concept?:</u></b><br>
            ComDash uses randomly generated wallpapers from Unsplash as it's background and displays critical infomation on top
            of it, this means it is important that the font colour of the info displayed does not mix with the colour of the
            background image. We have implemented boxes and borders around different infomation and gave them a background
            colour (preferably black) to help categorize and group similar infomation together.
            <br><br>
            The proposed UI has a glass-like effect which is based of a trend that started to grow in popularity in the end of 2020. 
            Its main characteristic is the background separation it achieves by using transparencies and blurs. This way the 
            effect resembles a frosted glass. It creates “through the glass” look and feel on the elements. The name of this 
            UI design trend is known as "Glassmorphism".<br><br>
        </p>


        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Why Use This UI Concept?:</u></b><br>
            The main reason why glassmorphism is being used is to establish a visual hierarchy and depth of the interface.<br>
            Whereas a skeuomorphic approach to glass would be to recreate the exact look (perhaps with window sills, window baskets,
            and panes to encourage the user to click to open), glassmorphism recreates the feeling of glass. The user would not be
            at risk of thinking they are seeing a real panel of glass on their screen, but a clear digital expression of the
            physical object.<br><br>
            1. Ultimately, it’s a useful technique for adding visual hierarchy to your designs, meaning you can encourage the user
            to focus on important areas of the UI.
            <br>2. It can make the layout look more attractive.
            <br>3. It’s versatile—this technique could be used across pretty much in any industry!
            <br>4. It can make sites or apps easier to navigate.
            <br>5. It’s a modern evolution of previous trends.<br>
            <br>While glassmorphism presents some potential challenges, such as readability issues and performance concerns, its
            benefits in enhancing visual hierarchy, promoting user engagement, and improving accessibility make it an attractive
            choice for designers looking to create captivating digital experiences.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Applying The New UI Concept On ComDash:</u></b><br>
            R&D came across an article on Glassmorphism while researching on different UI concepts and then decided to adopt this UI concept 
            since it uses a glass-like effect to not only hint at what's in the background but also helps to make sure that the displayed 
            text's colour doesn't mix with the background colour (Example, white font colour not mixing with a white background).<br>
            <br>Below is the image file of ComDash with Glassmorphism applied.
        </p>

        <label class="epic-justify">UI of ComDash After Implementing Glassmorphism</label>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            Upon adding Glassmorphism to ComDash, Text's colour can now be displayed properly without fears of overlapping with the background 
            picture's colour. On top of that, now UX and readability has also been improved thanks to the blur effect which gives users a hint 
            at what's going on in the background.<br><br>
            Below is the current code R&D has implemented into our css code to achieve Glassmorphism:<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c74aa63-c545-458b-8afc-b5e70835d693" width="500">
            
            <br><br>
            <b><u>R&D's Future Goals With Glassmorphism:</u></b><br>
            Although currently this code gets the job done R&D is currently commited to make sure that the existing code works and to research for better code 
            implementation/adoption in the long run to help put less strain on user's laptops and PCs when loading a website.
