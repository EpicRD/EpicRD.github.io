        <p class="epic-justify">
            Due to an issue with JARVIS, on <b>25-Sep-2020</b> Epicalable had decided to task
            R&D Department to come up with a solution and a detailed report on why said solution should be adopted.<br>
            Below is a detailed report on which Render-Word Engine was proposed at that time for consideration as a solution
            to Epicalable.
            <br>
            <b>The following report was presented to Epicalable on 10-Nov-2020.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Introduction:</u></b><br>
            Eversince Epicalable was formed we had an aim to create a chatbot coupled in a GUI to help users move away from the command-line 
            interface. Epicalable also had a long-term goal of creating a dataset stored on a seperate file which could be easily edited 
            by any user with no prior coding knowledge to help expand the chatbot's responses and vocabulary.<br><br>
            Most of the developers working on this project came up with a vague concept of creating an algorithm to run through a
            file in search of a given keywords by the user. Epicalable's Admin Department gave the green light to create this algorithm.<br>
            While working on the algorithm, we ran into some unforseen problems such as:<br>
            1. What type of file should we store our dataset in?<br>
            2. How are we going to extract the data from the file?<br>
            3. Could we show different outputs for the same input given in the chatbot?<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Getting To Work:</u></b><br>
            Upon getting the task to be done on our table, our Researchers firstly scoured the internet looking for which type of file 
            could best store our dataset. We came across many types such as xml, csv and xaml, but when coming across Json we found that it was easy to read 
            and write, supports strings, numbers and boolean and is data-oriented. So we decided to adopt Json and an added bonus was Python has support and 
            libaries for Json to help extract data.<br><br>
            Soon we created a json file and inserted our dataset with specific keywords in it. We created it based on the concept that once the user enters a 
            text, JARVIS will search for matching keywords in the text and would show a random appropriate output.
        </p>

        <label class="epic-justify">Jarindents: The file where the info is stored</label>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Problem Solving:</u></b><br>
            We ran into a new problem, retrieving data from a json file is kind of harder than accessing a dictionary. We would need to open the json file, followed by 
            taking the user's input and running it through the entire file for matching keywords under <b>'tags'</b> then display a random output from the list of available outputs 
            under <b>'response'</b>.<br><br>

            Our researchers at that time was quite used to looping so we decided to adopt that and also use the random library to help pick an output.
            
            We experimented with a <b>'for loop'</b> to loop through the entire file and an <b>'if loop'</b> to search for matching keywords. Once the matching keyword is 
            found we used the <b>'from random import choice'</b> library to randomly pick a output under <b>'response'</b>.<br><br>

            We also decided to capitalize each word that the user inputs to make sure it matches with our capitalized Json tags and in subsequent versions 
            once JarAudit was introduced as a way to audit the chatbot's history it was seeminglessly integrated into Render-word. Render-word would hence send the 
            input binded with the current time and it will be stored in the JarAudit file.

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Aftermath:</u></b>
            The concept worked and it was successfully implemented into our then under-developing chatbot. Admin Department was
            satisfied with the result and gave the green light to push this code to production. This issue also marks the 
            first time that Epicalable officially recognised the importance of a full time R&D Dept rather than a team from the 
            Coding Dept that works part-time as R&D researchers and hence the R&D Dept was formed.
