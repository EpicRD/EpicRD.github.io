            <b><u>Introduction:</u></b><br>
            Eversince Epicalable was formed, we had an aim to create a chatbot embedded in a GUI to help users move away from the command-line 
            interface. Epicalable also had a long-term goal of creating a dataset stored on a seperate file which could be easily edited 
            by any user with no prior coding knowledge to help expand the chatbot's responses and vocabulary.<br><br>
            Most of the developers working on this project came up with a vague concept of creating an algorithm to run through a
            file in search of a given keywords by the user. Epicalable's Admin Department gave the green light to create this algorithm.<br>
            While working on the algorithm, we ran into some unforseen problems such as:<br>
            1. What type of file should we store our dataset in?<br>
            2. How are we going to extract the data from the file?<br>
            3. Could we show different outputs for the same input given in the chatbot?<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>The Dataset:</u></b><br>
            Upon getting the task to be done on our table, our Researchers firstly scoured the internet looking for which type of file 
            could best store our dataset. We came across many types such as XML, CSV and XAML, but when coming across Json we found that it was easy to read 
            and write, supports strings, numbers and boolean and is data-oriented. So we decided to adopt Json and an added bonus was Python has built-in support and 
            libaries for Json to help extract data.<br><br>
            Soon we created a json file and inserted our dataset with specific keywords in it. We created it based on the concept that once the user enters a 
            text, JARVIS will search for matching keywords in the text and would show a random appropriate output.
        </p>

        <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6b83cae-53c3-49eb-82a0-26d2e2c3d7c6" width="350">
        <label class="epic-justify">jarintents: The file where the dataset is stored</label>


        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Searching Algorithm:</u></b><br>
            We ran into a new problem, retrieving data from a json file is kind of harder than accessing a dictionary. We would need to open the json file, followed by 
            taking the user's input and running it through the entire file for matching keywords under <b>'tags'</b> then display a random output from the list of available outputs 
            under <b>'response'</b>.<br><br>

            Our researchers at that time was quite used to looping so we decided to adopt that and also use the random library to help pick an output.
            
            We experimented with a <b>'for loop'</b> to loop through the entire file and an <b>'if loop'</b> to search for matching keywords. Once the matching keyword is 
            found we used the <b>'from random import choice'</b> library to randomly pick a output under <b>'response'</b>.<br><br>

            Sometimes the algorithm might pick wrong responses just because it has found a tag present inside a word. Example is
            when the user types in the word <b>'dolphin'</b>
            which has the sub-word <b>'hi'</b>, hence the algorithm will show the response for hi rather than for dolphin. This
            issue was circumvented
            by adding a space after each tag so that if a user enters <b>'hi'</b> it would look for any spaces behind and take input
            as <b>'hi '</b>, then for <b>'dolphin'</b>
            since there is no space as after 'hi' is the letter 'n', the appropriate response is given out.<br><br>
            We also decided to capitalize each word that the user inputs to make sure it matches with our capitalized Json tags and
            in subsequent versions
            once JarAudit was introduced as a way to audit the chatbot's history it was seeminglessly integrated into Render-word.
            Render-word would hence send the
            input binded with the current time and it will be stored in the JarAudit file.<br><br>
        </p>

            <b><u>Calculating the time and space complexity:</u></b><br>
            The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the number of intents in the Jarintents.json file. This is because the code iterates 
            through each intent in the Jarintents.json file and checks if the tags of the intent are present in the query input. Hence, the code snippet 
            contains a loop that iterates through the 'intents' list in the Jarintents file and time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of 
            elements in the 'intents' list.<br><br>
            
            The space complexity of this code is O(1) because the amount of additional space used does not depend on the size of the
            input.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Aftermath:</u></b><br>
            The concept worked and it was successfully implemented into our then under-developing chatbot. Admin Department was
            satisfied with the result and gave the green light to push this code to production. This issue also marks the 
            first time that Epicalable officially recognised the importance of a full time R&D Dept rather than a team from the 
            Coding Dept that works part-time as R&D researchers and hence the R&D Dept was formed.<br><br>
