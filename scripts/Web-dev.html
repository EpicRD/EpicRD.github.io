        <p class="epic-justify">
            Due to diffuculties and problems with our then-project JarDash's design choices, on <b>14-April-2023</b> Epicalable
            had decided to task R&D Department to help plan a solid UI which could be easily modified and maintainable.<br>
            Below is a detailed report which was proposed at that time for consideration as a solution to Epicalable.
            <br>
            <b>The following report was documented along the way and is still being actively being documented.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Introduction:</u></b><br>
            Epicalable's Admin and Coding Department had problems with the then-JarDash's design with regards to modifying it's 
            asthethics, User-Interface or during maintainance and troubleshooting. <br>Below is the envisioned concept-art of 
            JarDash announced during EpicNote 2022.
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>What Went Wrong:</u></b><br>
            We tried our best to think of what best features could be added to the dashboard and went online to search for code
            tutorials as we were dealing with a less studied language: JavaScript. So we pulled these codes from different parts of
            the internet with a belief that we will understand it and we could customize it afterwards. 
            <br><br>But, after going through the code we still couldn't understand how it was built. As Jardash had 4 parts: A date and
            time, Weather, Calander and news. We couldn't integrate all the code into 1 file, couldn't standardize the aesthetics
            and finally couldn't manipulate it to provide what we want it to produce be it different news or a different background
            color.
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Aftermath:</u></b><br>
            With the help of our new understanding of the way to create web-based projects, with the help of the Coding Dept, it took a
            total of 3 days to reach Dev phase 1 and honestly, we have never done something like this before and it was
            a great experience for everyone working on this project.<br><br>
            So, here are some remarkable features we've added to this project along the way:
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 1:</u></b><br>
            1. Background wallpaper will be shown based on the location of weather asked.<br>
            2. Translucent cards are made to display weather and news info.<br>
            3. Weather has a search bar to look up for other locations (soon to be extended to news section too).<br>
            4. Overall, a great leap in aesthetics compared to our previous iteration.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev1.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 1a:</u></b><br>
            1. Extended the news section till the bottom.<br>
            2. Re-positioned all the card elements.<br>
            3. Added A new icon for our app (We've made it colorful).<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev1a.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 2:</u></b><br>
            1. Integrated a new tasks div.<br>
            2. (C) Epicalable text at the bottom of the website.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev2.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 3:</u></b><br>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 4:</u></b><br>

            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev4.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 5a:</u></b><br>
            1. After adding Spotify and after reopening the same window Spotify would only 
            play preview of any songs.<br>
            2. We decided to settle on a card that brings you to important websites for 
            programmers to have and a search bar for easy accessibility to the internet.<br>
            3. We have also added some new features which helps to give the user more freedom 
            EX. Choosing which country news users want.<br>
            4. More tasks can be added and also added a 'help buttons' for clueless users.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev5.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 6:</u></b><br>
            1. Day progress bar added to know when the day ends.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev6.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 6a:</u></b><br>
            1. ComDash logo on the top has been added.<br>
            2. <a href="./Glassmorphism.html">Glassmorphism</a> has been applied for the first time.<br>
            3. New Day progress bar added to know when the day ends.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev6a.png" width="350">
        </p>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Dev Phase 8 (Quality Rollout):</u></b><br>
            1. New settings page added for better UX in the sidebar.<br>
            2. New links added in the link card.<br>
            3. About-us link in the sidebar.<br>
            <img class="epic-image epic-round-large" src="./Addons/dev8.png" width="350">
        </p><br>

        <p class="epic-justify">
            <b><u>Conclusion:</u></b><br>
            Looking back at the first few ComDash photos now seems wonky and a bit ugly.
            It shows how far we have come and what we have built which makes current iteration make the first few iterations look
            bad on comparison.<br>
            ComDash is and will always be growing in order to reach our targeted concept-art.
